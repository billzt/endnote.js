                At the University of Manchester, a team under the leadership of Tom Kilburn designed and built 
                a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves.<span class="endnote">Lavington, 
                Simon (1998), A History of Manchester Computers (2 ed.), Swindon: The British Computer Society, 
                pp. 34-35</span> Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, 
                and a second version was completed there in April 1955. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock 
                waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the 
                first completely transistorized computer. That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955,
